1. Put all Audio Notes, Piano.html , Stylesheet.css and Script.js file in the *same folder*  to run this project.
2. * Complet Virtual Piano.html * is copy of same project having css and js embedded  so put this file and audio notes in same folder and run.
3. This project need time to sync audio notes so please wait for few seconds after pressing piano key first time after that you hear
    sound of audio note and now your are all set to play virtual piano.
    Thank You :) .
